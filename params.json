{"name":"amazon","tagline":"The amazon floating fab lab project","body":"### Welcome to Amazon Floating Fab Lab.\r\nThe initiative is to create a digital fabrication laboratory (Fab Lab) that will navigate the Amazon River. It will provide local communities with access to technological tools that allow them to cope with their daily challenges with water, energy, health, food, education while at the same time, serve as a place for research and development to better understand the Amazon. Because it is a green lung of the world, the Amazon is the ideal scene for exploring alternative solutions in favor of a responsible industry which is sensible and integrated to local and global developments.\r\n\r\n### How can we help? \r\nBy integrating efforts for the local people (especially children) to expand their opportunities to access technological and social innovation programs.\r\n\r\n### The Amazon\r\nThe richest territory of the planet, both in biodiversity and multiculturalism, the Amazon is one of the most affected by global warming and social exclusion. Deforestation, extinction of species and cultures threaten the Amazon, where most of the population does not have access to education and basic public services. There is an urge to develop projects to enhance the conservation and sustainable development of natural and cultural resources.\r\n\r\n### Team\r\n\r\n### Contact\r\nhttp://amazon.fablat.org/\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
